              <p class="about-patent__text">A patent is an enforceable writ providing inventors rights to practice their
                invention while restricting competitors from appropriating the invention, or practicing embodiments of
                the
                invention, without licensing the invention from the inventor.
              </p>
              <p class="about-patent__text"> A patent is issued by the US Patent and Trademark Office, granting a
                temporary monopoly of the invention, in exchange for a full disclosure of the invention. The temporary
                monopoly granted an inventor is offered only in exchange for a full disclosure of the invention. A
                patent
                is, therefore, not an award for an inventor’s novel discovery, rather it is a tool used to effect
                disclosure of inventions for the public good.</p>
              <p class="about-patent__text">
                To secure your patent you must “enable” your invention in a patent disclosure. “Enablement” means that
                any
                person having ordinary skill in the filed of your invention would be able to practice the invention from
                reading the patent disclosure alone.</p>

                  filing fees for “microentities” and “small entities”. To qualify as a microentity, you must have
                  reported a gross income of less than $150,162 last year and have less than four patents in your name.
                  If you’re not a microentity, then you’re likely a small entity (unless you are a large corporation)..

              <p class="about-patent__text about-patent__text_bottom">• For utility and design applications, the
                application is queued in the Patent Office. It may take more than 18 months for a response to issue from
                the USPTO. Williams Intellectual Property will argue any Office Actions issued from the USPTO until
                prosecution on the application is closed, and the patent issues or is abandoned.</p>
              <p class="about-patent__text about-patent__text_bottom">• For provisional applications, remember you have
                12 months to effect a utility filing to maintain the priority of the provisional’s filing date. Failure
                to file the utility application within 12 months will result in the provisional application’s
                abandonment. For an example of a priority date established between a provisional application and a
                subsequently filed utility application, please refer to the time line below.</p>
