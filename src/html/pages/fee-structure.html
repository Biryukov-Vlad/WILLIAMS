                  Williams Intellectual Property charges flat fees for patent prosecution in the United States. We don’t
                  add surcharges onto any government filing fees or bill you additional fees (including Office Action
                  responses and amendments) until prosecution on your patent application is closed. Utility and Design
                  fees include all office action responses incurred during prosecution of your patent application.</p>
                <p class="price__text">
                  You may incur separate fees for drawings (to a drafting company, if needed), or actions subsequent
                  closure of prosecution, such as continuing prosecution, continuing applications, requests for
                  continued examination, continuation-in-part applications, and any interference proceedings. In most
                  instances the fee you pay us will carry you through to issuance or abandonment of your patent
                  application. Call us for a free consultation if you’d like more information regarding our fees.</p>
